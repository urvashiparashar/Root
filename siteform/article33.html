            Not all uses of time are equal, and this simple truth can make a big difference in life. 
            People who spend their time doing more profitable work make more money. 
            People who spend their time investing in others build better relationships. 
            People who spend their time creating a flexible career enjoy more freedom. 
            People who spend their time working on high-impact projects contribute more to society. 
            Whether you want more wealth, more friendship, more freedom, or more impact, it all comes down to how you spend and value your time.

    <p id="part-b" style="color: blanchedalmond; font-size: 22px;">
        At some level, we all have an internal gauge for how much our time is worth.
         For example, if someone offers to pay you $0.07 for one hour of work, you would 
         immediately decline. Meanwhile, if someone offers to pay you $7,000 for one hour 
         of work, you would immediately accept.
 <br>
 <br><p id="part-c" style="color: blanchedalmond; font-size: 22px;">
    On extreme ends of the spectrum, it is easy to know if a task is worth your time. 
    As you move toward the middle of the time-value spectrum, however, it becomes less clear 
    if a particular task is worth your time or not. And this is the problem: most of life is 
    lived in the gray zone of the time-value spectrum.
     
    </p> <br>  
    <p id="part-d" style="color: blanchedalmond; font-size: 22px;">
        For example:
        <ul id="part-d" style="color: blanchedalmond; font-size: 22px;">
            <li> Should you buy the nonstop flight and save two hours or get the flight with a stopover
                and save Rs2000?
            </li>

        </ul>

    We make choices like these everyday, but most people base their decisions on gut feelings 
    or guesswork and never calculate what their time is actually worth. Everyone has an hourly 
    value, but very few people can actually tell you what that number is.
