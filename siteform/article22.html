                <p id="part-b">
                    Our minds hold onto negative experiences more readily and for longer than positive ones. Negative events like losing money vs. making money or being insulted vs. praised have a higher stickiness factor than the alternative. The negativity bias, which no one is immune to, is the reason it feels worse to lose $50 than it does to make $50.

                You might be able to remember an entire day for one negative experience, like someone criticizing one of your ideas, when the whole day weighed heavily in the positive. </p>

            <h3 id="part-a">But how can we fight negative thoughts?</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="point-1">1. Identify what happened with neutral thinking.</p>
            <p id="part-b">
                Neutral thinking gives way to positivity. 

                It all starts with how we talk to ourselves. Looking at things through a neutral lens is a critical step. Then, try to self-trigger on your negative self-talk and put effort into maximizing the positive.  
            </p>
         <br>
         <br> <p id="point-1">2. If you want to take it to the next level use gratitude.</p>
         <p id="part-b">
            Take a few moments to take stock of all the 'wins' you had in a  day. These are the times you feel genuinely grateful that things went your way. Even on the worst days, there are still opportunities to feel thankful.

            <p id="point-1">3. Even your bad days can become good days
                <p id="part-b">
                When you feel thankful, it feels good. It changes you on a physiological and psychological level. In short, it overrides the negative thoughts you had about your day so you can fall asleep feeling at ease and content with your so-called 'bad' day. 
            </p>
            <p id="part-b">
            We all tend to buy into the negative, but it doesn't have to be that way. We can all be more kind to ourselves with a bit of effort, changing our default thought patterns toward positivity, and filtering out the silver linings.
