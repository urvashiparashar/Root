        <p id="part-a">Emotional Resilience is a person’s ability to adapt to stressful situations or crises.</p>

        <p id="part-b">
            More resilient people are agile and can “roll with the punches”, bounce back and adapt to adversity, without lasting difficulties.

Forbes Magazine created a short video that highlighted that it’s not the smartest in school who is the most resilient. The one who has ‘grit’ always wins over IQ and a combination of persistence, hard work and passion creates resilient people.

         Diane Coutu in May 2002 in the Harvard Review in an article, How Resilience Works  says “my exploration has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Indeed, resilience is one of the great puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct.”</p>

        In January 2015 a Harvard Business Review article ‘What Resilience Means, and Why it Matters’ reported on the research of a pair of British consultants confirmed the importance of resilience to business success. Resilience was 
        defined by most as the ability to recover from setbacks, adapt well to change, and keep going in the face of adversity.

    Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg gave a powerful and emotional commencement speech 
    on building resilience to the University of California, Berkeley’s Class of 2016.
     
    </p>   
    <p id="part-d">
        Sandberg said, “You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience, but like a muscle, you can build it up and draw on it when you need it. In that process, you will figure out who you really are — and you just might become the very best version of yourself.”

Some believe resilience means restoring mental health after a traumatic event. Others consider it a conscious determination to persevere under difficult circumstances. 
 To complicate matters, humanitarian groups use the term resilience to describe any or all these positive outcome.
